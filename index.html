            <h3>Course Introduction</h3>
            <p><strong>Design and Analysis of Algorithms</strong> taught us how to solve problems efficiently using algorithms. The course helps us understand how to design solutions to problems, analyze their performance, and make sure they work well in real-world applications.</p>

            <h4>Data Structures and Algorithms We Studied:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Binary Search Trees (BST)</strong>: Used to organize data for quick searching in a hierarchy.</li>
                <li><strong>AVL Trees</strong>: A balanced version of BSTs, ensuring faster searches.</li>
                <li><strong>Red-Black Trees</strong>: A self-balancing binary search tree for quick operations and data retrieval.</li>
                <li><strong>2-3 Trees</strong>: A balanced search tree that helps store and retrieve data efficiently.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For each of these topics, we focused on understanding both the theory and practical usage, helping us apply the concepts effectively in real-world situations.</p>

            <h4>Connecting the Course with Real-Time Applications:</h4>
            <p>Algorithms are used in many things we use every day, such as search engines, social media, and GPS systems. This course helped us understand the logic behind these technologies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Search Algorithms in Everyday Use</strong>: We saw how algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) are essential for exploring connections in networks. For example, DFS can find all possible paths between two friends on social media, while BFS finds the quickest path.</li>
                <li><strong>Managing Large Data in Databases</strong>: We learned how AVL and Red-Black Trees help organize data efficiently in databases, making it quicker to search through millions of records. We also studied how heaps organize data in a way that speeds up data retrieval.</li>
            </ul>

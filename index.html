    <dt><br><br>Data Structures And Algorithms Studied</dt></h1>
<h3 style="color:  #FFC107;">Data Structures</h3>
<li>Trees: n-ary Trees, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, Trie, Skip List, Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees
<li>Graphs: Directed, undirected, weighted graphs, and also adjacency matrix and adjacency list
<li>Heap (min/max), lookup tables, etc.
<h3 style="color: #FFC107;">Algorithms</h3>
<li>Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort</li>
<li>String Search Algorithms: Boyer-Moore, Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Rabin-Karp</li>
<li>Graph Algorithms: BFS, DFS, Krushkal, Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, Prim’s, etc.</li>
      <h3 style="color: #FFC107;"> Connecting the Course with Real-Time Applications</h3>
<li>We connect the course with real-time applications by applying the algorithms in the course project of city design.
<li>By understanding the design principles behind the algorithms, we implement them to solve problems faced in designing a city.

<h3 style="color: #FFC107;">Course Project Introduction</h3>
<li>Suryakshetra is a well planned urban smart city with area of 1500 sq.km in Gujarat, it is strategically chosen as its proximity to established cities like Rajkot, Porbandar, and Junagadh.</li>
<li>This city model aspires to balance growth, sustainability, and livability while addressing key challenges of urbanization in India.</li>
<li>Aligning with the Government of India’s mission to promote sustainable and inclusive cities, Suryakshetra will integrate smart technologies, improve urban infrastructure, and enhance the quality of life.</li>

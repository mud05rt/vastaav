    <h2>Course Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Design and Analysis of Algorithms course helped us learn how to solve problems in smart and efficient ways. It focuses on designing algorithms for different problems and ensuring they are both correct and fast. Starting with basic ideas and advancing to complex concepts, the course enhances our ability to create efficient solutions.</p>
    
    <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms Studied So Far:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Binary Search Trees:</strong> Used to organize and quickly search through hierarchical data.</li>
        <li><strong>AVL Trees:</strong> A balanced version of BSTs, ensuring faster search operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Red-Black Trees:</strong> A self-balancing binary search tree ensuring logarithmic height.</li>
        <li><strong>2-3 Trees:</strong> A self-balancing search tree used to efficiently store and retrieve data.</li>
    </ul>

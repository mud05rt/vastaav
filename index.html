        <h2>Data Structures and Algorithms Studied</h2>
        <h3>Data Structures</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Trees: n-ary Trees, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, Trie, Skip List, Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees</li>
            <li>Graphs: Directed, undirected, weighted graphs, adjacency matrix, and adjacency list</li>
            <li>Heap (min/max), lookup tables, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Algorithms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort</li>
            <li>String Search Algorithms: Boyer-Moore, Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Rabin-Karp</li>
            <li>Graph Algorithms: BFS, DFS, Kruskal’s, Dijkstra’s, Floyd-Warshall, Prim’s, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Connecting the Course with Real-Time Applications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We connect the course with real-time applications by applying the algorithms in the course project of city design.</li>
            <li>By understanding the design principles behind the algorithms, we implement them to solve problems faced in designing a city.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Course Project Introduction</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Suryakshetra is a well-planned urban smart city with an area of 1500 sq.km in Gujarat. It is strategically chosen for its proximity to established cities like Rajkot, Porbandar, and Junagadh.</li>
            <li>This city model aspires to balance growth, sustainability, and livability while addressing key challenges of urbanization in India.</li>
            <li>Aligning with the Government of India’s mission to promote sustainable and inclusive cities, Suryakshetra will integrate smart technologies, improve urban infrastructure, and enhance the quality of life.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Course Introduction</h2>
    <p>Design and Analysis of Algorithms course helped us to learn how to solve problems that are seen around us in smart and efficient ways. It focuses on how to design algorithms for different problems and how to make sure that the provided solutions work well and quickly. Starting with basic ideas and moving to advanced concepts, the course helps us understand, analyze, and create algorithms that are both correct and fast.</p>
    
    <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms Studied So Far:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Binary Search Trees:</strong> Used to organize and quickly search through data arranged in a hierarchy.</li>
        <li><strong>AVL Trees:</strong> A more balanced version of BSTs, making search faster.</li>
        <li><strong>Red-Black Trees:</strong> A self-balancing binary search tree that guarantees logarithmic height and fast operations.</li>
        <li><strong>2-3 Trees:</strong> A self-balancing search tree used to store and retrieve data efficiently.</li>
    </ul>
